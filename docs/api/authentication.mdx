# API Authentication üîê

Caddy Control uses API keys for authenticating requests to the API. This page explains how to create, use, and manage API keys for secure access to the Caddy Control API.

## API Key Authentication üîë

All API requests to Caddy Control require authentication via an API key. API keys provide a simple and secure way to authenticate with the API without using user credentials.

### Using API Keys

To authenticate your API requests, include your API key in the `x-api-key` HTTP header:

```bash
curl -X GET https://your-caddy-control-domain.com/api/domains \
  -H "x-api-key: your_api_key_here"
```

### API Key Security üõ°Ô∏è

API keys have full access to your Caddy Control instance, so it's important to keep them secure:

- Store keys securely in environment variables or a secure key management system
- Never expose keys in client-side code or public repositories
- Use different keys for different applications or services
- Rotate keys regularly

## Managing API Keys üìã

### Creating API Keys

You can create API keys either through the Caddy Control dashboard or via the API:

#### Via the Dashboard

1. Log in to your Caddy Control dashboard
2. Navigate to the "API Keys" section
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Enter a descriptive name for the key
5. Copy and securely store the generated key (it will not be shown again)

#### Via the API

Send a POST request to the `/api/key` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-caddy-control-domain.com/api/key \
  -H "x-api-key: your_existing_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Development Key"}'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "clqr5l9d50001sy2uorjt2wua",
    "name": "Development Key",
    "keyId": "keyid_123456",
    "key": "key_f7sd89f7s98df79s8df7s9d8f7",
    "createdAt": "2025-04-18T08:59:25.481Z"
  },
  "message": "API key created successfully. Please save your key as it won't be displayed again."
}
```

**Important:** The full API key is only returned once when it's created. Make sure to copy and securely store it, as you won't be able to retrieve it later.

### Listing API Keys üìù

You can view all your current API keys (without the full key value) through:

#### Dashboard

Navigate to the "API Keys" section in the dashboard.

#### API

```bash
curl -X GET https://your-caddy-control-domain.com/api/key \
  -H "x-api-key: your_api_key_here"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "clqr5l9d50001sy2uorjt2wua",
      "name": "Development Key",
      "keyId": "keyid_123456",
      "createdAt": "2025-04-18T08:59:25.481Z"
    }
  ],
  "total": 1
}
```

### Deleting API Keys üóëÔ∏è

If an API key is no longer needed or may have been compromised, you should delete it:

#### Dashboard

1. Go to the "API Keys" section
2. Find the key you want to delete
3. Click the delete button and confirm the deletion

#### API

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://your-caddy-control-domain.com/api/key/clqr5l9d50001sy2uorjt2wua \
  -H "x-api-key: your_api_key_here"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "message": "API key deleted successfully"
}
```

## Best Practices for API Key Management ‚úÖ

1. **Use Descriptive Names**: Give each key a clear purpose in its name, like "Production Server" or "Development Testing"
2. **Implement Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate your API keys, especially for production environments
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: In future versions with role-based permissions, assign only the permissions needed for each key
4. **Monitor Key Usage**: Keep track of how and when keys are being used
5. **Revoke Unused Keys**: Delete any API keys that are no longer in use
6. **Secure Storage**: Store API keys in environment variables or secure key management solutions
7. **Never Commit Keys**: Always exclude API keys from version control

## Troubleshooting Authentication Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

If you're experiencing authentication issues:

1. **Verify the API key**: Make sure the key being used is valid and correctly formatted
2. **Check the header name**: Ensure you're using `x-api-key` (case-sensitive)
3. **Key permissions**: Check if the key might have limited permissions
4. **Recently created key**: If you just created the key, it might take a moment to propagate

### Common Authentication Errors

| Error Message | Possible Cause |
|--------------|----------------|
| "Invalid API key" | The API key doesn't exist or is formatted incorrectly |
| "API key required" | The `x-api-key` header is missing |
| "API key expired" | The key has been revoked or expired (if expiry is implemented) |
| "API key lacks permission" | The key doesn't have permission for the requested action (future feature) |
