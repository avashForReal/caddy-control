# API Overview

Caddy Control provides a comprehensive REST API that allows you to programmatically manage domains, proxy configurations, and API keys. This overview introduces the core concepts of the API.

## Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to your Caddy Control installation:

```
https://your-caddy-control-domain.com/api
```

Replace `your-caddy-control-domain.com` with the domain where you've deployed Caddy Control.

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using API keys. Include your API key in the `x-api-key` header:

```bash
curl -X GET https://your-caddy-control-domain.com/api/domains \
  -H "x-api-key: your_api_key_here"
```

API keys can be created and managed through the Caddy Control dashboard or via the API. See the [Authentication](/docs/api/authentication) section for more details.

## Response Format

API responses are returned in JSON format. Successful responses typically include a `data` property containing the requested information.

### Success Response Example

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "cm8o9l9d50001sy2uorjt2wua",
    "incomingAddress": "example.com",
    "destinationAddress": "destination-server.com",
    "port": 443,
    "isLocked": false,
    "enableHttps": true,
    "createdAt": "2025-04-18T08:59:25.481Z"
  }
}
```

### Error Response Example

```json
{
  "error": "Domain already exists",
  "status": 400
}
```

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse. If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. The response headers include information about your rate limit status.

## Available Endpoints

Caddy Control API endpoints are organized into the following categories:

### Domain Management

- [GET /api/domains](/docs/api/endpoints#get-domains) - List all registered domains
- [POST /api/domain/add](/docs/api/endpoints#add-domain) - Add a new domain
- [DELETE /api/domain/:id](/docs/api/endpoints#delete-domain) - Delete a domain by ID

### Caddy Configuration

- [GET /api/caddy/config](/docs/api/endpoints#get-caddy-config) - Get the current Caddy configuration

### API Key Management

- [GET /api/key](/docs/api/endpoints#get-api-keys) - List all API keys
- [POST /api/key](/docs/api/endpoints#create-api-key) - Create a new API key
- [DELETE /api/key/:id](/docs/api/endpoints#delete-api-key) - Delete an API key by ID

## API Versioning

The current API is considered v1 and does not require a version prefix in the URL. Future API versions will be announced and documented accordingly.

## SDKs & Libraries

Currently, there are no official SDKs for the Caddy Control API. The API is designed to be easily consumed using standard HTTP clients in any programming language.

## Best Practices

1. **Store API Keys Securely**: Never expose your API keys in client-side code or public repositories.
2. **Implement Retry Logic**: For production applications, implement retry logic with exponential backoff for failed requests.
3. **Handle Rate Limits**: Be prepared to handle rate limit errors by implementing proper backoff strategies.
4. **Validate Input**: Always validate input data before sending it to the API to ensure proper formatting.
5. **Monitor API Usage**: Keep track of your API usage to stay within rate limits and optimize your application.
