# Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you get started with Caddy Control by walking you through the essential tasks: logging in, managing domains, and creating API keys.

## Logging In

After installation, access your Caddy Control dashboard using the domain you configured during setup. The default credentials are:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin`

You'll be prompted to change your password after the first login.

## Dashboard Overview

The Caddy Control dashboard is organized into several key sections:

- **Dashboard Home**: Overview of your proxy configurations
- **Domains**: Manage your domain routing configurations
- **API Keys**: Create and manage API keys for programmatic access
- **Settings**: Configure system settings and user preferences

## Managing Domains

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Step 1: Add a New Domain</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      <div>
        <p>From the Domains page, click on "Add Domain" to open the domain configuration form.</p>
        
        <p>Fill in the following information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Incoming Address</strong>: The domain that users will visit (e.g., custom-domain.com)</li>
          <li><strong>Destination Address</strong>: The upstream server or IP where traffic should be proxied</li>
          <li><strong>Port</strong>: The port on the destination (usually 443 for HTTPS or 80 for HTTP)</li>
          <li><strong>Enable HTTPS</strong>: Toggle to enable/disable HTTPS for this domain</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </StepContent>
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Step 2: Configure DNS</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      <div>
        <p>For your domain to work with Caddy Control:</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>Go to your domain registrar or DNS provider</li>
          <li>Create an A record pointing your domain to your Caddy Control server's IP address</li>
          <li>Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours, but often much faster)</li>
        </ol>
        
        <FolderTree className="overflow-hidden p-2">
          <Folder element="DNS Configuration" defaultOpen={true}>
            <File>
              <p>custom-domain.com (A) â†’ Your Server IP</p>
            </File>
          </Folder>
        </FolderTree>
        
        <Note>
          Caddy Control performs checks to verify that your domain's DNS is properly configured to point to your server.
        </Note>
      </div>
    </StepContent>
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Step 3: Check Domain Status</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      <div>
        <p>Caddy Control performs automatic checks on your domains:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>DNS Check</strong>: Verifies that the domain resolves to your proxy IP</li>
          <li><strong>Proxy Reachability</strong>: Ensures requests reach the proxy</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>These checks help diagnose configuration issues and ensure your domain is properly set up.</p>
        
        <Note>
          Caddy automatically handles SSL/TLS certificate acquisition and renewal through Let's Encrypt once DNS is properly configured.
        </Note>
      </div>
    </StepContent>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing API Keys

API keys allow programmatic access to Caddy Control, which is essential for automating domain management in your applications.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Step 1: Create an API Key</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      <div>
        <ol>
          <li>Navigate to the "API Keys" section in the dashboard</li>
          <li>Click on "Create API Key"</li>
          <li>Enter a descriptive name for your key</li>
          <li>Click "Create" to generate the key</li>
        </ol>
        
        <Note>
          Make sure to copy and securely store your API key when it's displayed. For security reasons, the full key will not be shown again.
        </Note>
      </div>
    </StepContent>
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Step 2: Using API Keys</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      <div>
        <p>To authenticate your API requests, include your API key in the request headers:</p>
        
        ```bash
        curl -X GET https://your-caddy-control-domain.com/api/domains \
          -H "x-api-key: your_api_key_here"
        ```
        
        <p>See the API Reference section for complete documentation of available endpoints.</p>
      </div>
    </StepContent>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using the API

Caddy Control provides a comprehensive API for managing domains programmatically. Here's a quick example of adding a domain via the API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-caddy-control-domain.com/api/domain/add \
  -H "x-api-key: your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "domain": "api-example.com",
    "destination": "internal-service.com",
    "port": "443",
    "enableHttps": true
  }'
```

For more detailed information about the available API endpoints, check out the [API Reference](/docs/api/overview) section.

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Backups**: Periodically export your Caddy configuration
2. **API Key Security**: Rotate API keys regularly and never share them publicly
3. **DNS Configuration**: Ensure your DNS settings are correct before adding domains
4. **Monitoring**: Regularly check domain status for any configuration issues
